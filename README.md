# Deployment Strategies of Cloud

## Introduction
First, let us understand what Cloud is and what cloud computing is before diving into cloud deployment strategies. The cloud provides computing resources like storage, RAM, CPU, and networking over the internet.

Cloud computing involves using these on-demand resources over the internet for deploying applications or other tasks without requiring physical hardware. It ensures accessibility, scalability, observability, reliability, security, and more. Organizations adopt cloud computing to reduce operational costs, improve efficiency, and enhance collaboration by allowing remote access to applications and data.

Cloud computing operates on three main models:

### IAAS (Infrastructure as a Service):
- Provides essential computing resources such as networking, virtual machines, and storage.
- Offers on-demand computing with scalability, elasticity, and full infrastructure control.
- **Examples**: AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for businesses needing complete control over infrastructure with flexibility to scale resources up or down as needed.

### PAAS (Platform as a Service):
- Provides a platform for developing, deploying, and managing applications without handling infrastructure.
- The cloud provider manages OS, middleware, and runtime environments.
- **Examples**: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Services.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for developers who want to focus on application development without worrying about managing underlying infrastructure.

### SAAS (Software as a Service):
- Delivers software applications over the internet via a subscription model.
- The cloud provider manages infrastructure, platform, and applications.
- **Examples**: Dropbox, Google Workspace, Salesforce.
- **Use Case**: Best for businesses looking for ready-to-use applications that require minimal setup and maintenance.

## Cloud Deployment Models:
Cloud services can be deployed in different models based on business needs, security requirements, and cost considerations:

### 1. Public Cloud:
- Resources are owned and managed by third-party cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure.
- Shared among multiple users over the internet.
- **Examples**: Netflix using AWS, Gmail using Google Cloud.
- **Advantages**: Scalability, reliability, global reach, lower costs.
- **Disadvantages**: Shared resources, potential security concerns.
- **Use Case**: Best for startups and businesses looking for cost-effective solutions with minimal infrastructure management.

### 2. Private Cloud:
- Resources are exclusively used and owned by a single organization.
- Greater control, security, and customization.
- **Examples**: OpenStack, VMware, IBM Cloud Private.
- **Advantages**: Full control, high security, increased performance.
- **Disadvantages**: High setup and maintenance costs.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for enterprises handling sensitive data, such as healthcare and financial institutions.
